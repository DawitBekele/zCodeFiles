Though the hash code and equals methods were overriden in the Employee class to determine
equality between objects and to store in the hash map,  the hash code need to be computed based on
the type and number of parameters used in the equals overriden method. here for the equals method
three parameters were used(name,salary and visited) but for the hash code(name and salary) were used
to compute the hash code. so this is not the proper way to do it for this scenario.
