when the jvm calls method it does based on the actual object not the reference of the object
so the the refrerece p1 point to an object of PersonWithJob so its equals methods will be envoked, when compred with p2(an object of person)
they are not equal.Where as in the second call of the equals method jvm call person's equals as the objet it refrence is type person
so when we compare the two object based on this person's equal method, they have the same name and hence they are equal.
